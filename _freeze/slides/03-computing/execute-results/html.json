We'll workshop these pieces in class before they're due.\n\n## Grading\n\n| Category                                    | Percentage |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| In-class exercises                          | 35%        |\n| Project component 1: proposal               | 10%        |\n| Project component 2: descriptive statistics | 10%        |\n| Project component 3: results                | 10%        |\n| Project component 4: presentation           | 10%        |\n| Project component 5: final paper            | 25%        |\n\n## Late work and regrades\n\n-   Project components and in-class exercises may be submitted up to 3 days late\n-   If you submit at least 80% of the daily exercises on time, you will receive full credit for the “in-class exercises” portion of your grade!\n-   I'll only change a grade if I've made a clear error\n\n## Academic honesty\n\nYou must be the principal author of your own work!\n\n## Basically:\n\n-   You can collaborate with other students, but don't copy their code directly\n-   You can use online resources (like StackOverflow, but if you use code from these sources, make that clear)\n-   Don't let AI write your code\n\n# Toolkit: Computing\n\n## Learning goals {.smaller}\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to...\n\n::: incremental\n-   gain insight from data\n-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques\n:::\n\n::: aside\nToday's slides adapted from Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's Intro to Data Science (STA199) course\n:::\n\n# Reproducible data analysis\n\n## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nWhat does it mean for a data analysis to be \"reproducible\"?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Near-term goals:**\n\n-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?\n-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?\n-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?\n\n. . .\n\n**Long-term goals:**\n\n-   Can other people check your work?\n-   Can the code be used for other data?\n-   Can you extend the code to do other things?\n\n## Toolkit for reproducibility\n\n-   Scriptability $\\rightarrow$ R / RStudio\n-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\\rightarrow$ Quarto\n-   Version control $\\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub\n\n# R and RStudio\n\n## R and RStudio {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/03/r-logo.png){fig-alt=\"R logo\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**\n-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics\n-   It's easily extensible with *packages*\n:::\n\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/03/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio logo\"}\n\n-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *\"I write R code in the RStudio IDE\"*\n-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists\n:::\n:::\n\n## R vs. RStudio\n\n[![](images/03/r_vs_rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"On the left: a car engine. On the right: a car dashboard. The engine is labelled R.

Annotated to show the YAML, a link, a header, and a code chunk.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## How will we use Quarto?\n\n-   Every assignment / report / project / etc. is a Quarto document\n-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with\n-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester\n\n# Toolkit: Version control, organization, collaboration\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/03/phd_comics_vc.gif)\n\n## Git and GitHub {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/03/git-logo.png){fig-alt=\"Git logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"200\"}\n\n-   Git is a version control system -- like \"Track Changes\" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids\n-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/03/github-logo.png){fig-alt=\"GitHub logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"200\"}\n\n-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better\n\n-   We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)\n:::\n:::\n\n# How it all fits together\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/03/whole-game-01.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/03/whole-game-02.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/03/whole-game-03.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/03/whole-game-04.png)\n\n## Install time!\n\n-   Setting up is the hardest part...\n-   Then go to our course webpage , click on \"Computing\" in the side bar, and then click on \"Setup\".\n-   Today's exercise: Work through these installation steps with a partner on the same operating system\n",
