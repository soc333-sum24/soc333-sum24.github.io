Part 4 is today and tomorrow.\n    -   I'm around before/after class for questions (after generally better), or set up an appointment\n\n## Today {.smaller}\n\n-   Answers to filtering\n-   Pipes\n-   Working on creating variables\n-   Answers to creating variables\n-   Plots\n\n## Filtering exercise (ex-5-31): answers! {.smaller}\n\n-   Find this on your computer (no need to clone it again)\n\n## Stringing commands together with pipes (`|>`)\n\n::: incremental\n-   Often we need to change data frames in more than one way\n-   Example from last week: How does employment status vary by age category?\n-   We need to create an age category variable (as we talked about Thursday)\n-   But we probably want to filter too--why analyze kids?\n:::\n\n## Stringing commands together: approach 1\n\nWe can do this with the tools we have.\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first we make the new variable\nacs12_newagevar <- mutate(acs12, agecat = case_when(age < 14 ~ \"child\",\n                                                    age < 18 ~ \"teen\",\n                                                    age < 67 ~ \"adult\",\n                                                    TRUE ~ \"retired\"))\n\n# then we filter to remove children\nacs12_nokids <- filter(acs12_newagevar, agecat != \"child\")\n\n# did it work?\ntable(acs12_nokids$agecat, useNA = \"always\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n  adult retired    teen    <NA> \n   1264     297      89       0 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n-   But it's kind of ugly... we don't need to save that middle step\n\n## Stringing commands together: approach 2, with `|>`\n\n::: incremental\n-   The pipe operator, `|>`, lets us pass the result of one function directly into another one\n-   The `|` symbol is the key below \"delete\" on your keyboard (not I, not l, not 1)\n-   It replaces the first mutate/filter argument (the dataset)\n-   \"Take the thing that came before this and give it to the function that comes after this\"\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12_nokids <- acs12 |> # start with acs12\n  mutate(agecat = case_when(age < 14 ~ \"child\", #then add a new variable to it\n                            age < 18 ~ \"teen\",\n                            age < 67 ~ \"adult\",\n                            TRUE ~ \"retired\")) |> \n  filter(agecat != \"child\") # then filter out the kids\n\ntable(acs12_nokids$agecat, useNA = \"always\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n  adult retired    teen    <NA> \n   1264     297      89       0 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Another `|>` example\n\n-   This:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmutate(acs12, agecat = case_when(age < 14 ~ \"child\",\n                                 age < 18 ~ \"teen\",\n                                 age < 67 ~ \"adult\",\n                                 TRUE ~ \"retired\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Is the same as this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12 |> \n  mutate(agecat = case_when(age < 14 ~ \"child\",\n                            age < 18 ~ \"teen\",\n                            age < 67 ~ \"adult\",\n                            TRUE ~ \"retired\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## More on `|>`\n\n::: incremental\n-   We're just scratching the surface in this class\n\n-   When you need to clean your data or when your analyses are more complex, `|>` makes your life a lot easier!\n\n-   Sometimes in internet resources more than \\~2 years old, you'll see `%>%` instead--this older version does exactly the same thing\n\n-   Annoying to type out?\n    There's a keyboard shortcut\n\n    -   on mac, command-shift-M\n    -   on pc, ctrl-shift-M\n:::\n\n## Continuing on creating new variables {.smaller}\n\n-   Find your exercise from last Thursday (ex-6-01)\n\n    -   No need to clone it again; find where it's saved on your computer\n\n-   There are hints on the website--use them if you get stuck\n\n-   10-15 minutes to work\n\n# Creating new variables: answers!\n",
