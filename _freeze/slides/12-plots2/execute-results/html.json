Some new function options, some new geoms.\n\n## Types of plots for different combinations of variables: overview\n\n-   One numeric variable\n\n    -   Histogram, `geom_histogram()`\n\n-   One categorical variable\n\n    -   Bar chart, `geom_bar()`\n\n. . .\n\n-   Two numeric variables\n\n    -   Scatterplots, `geom_point()`\n\n-   One numeric and one categorical variable\n\n    -   Boxplots, `geom_boxplot()`\n    \n-   Two categorical variables\n\n    -   Bar chart with color or facets\n\n. . .\n\n-   This is not the be-all end-all list; there are more options! But these are common and useful places to start.\n\n## What about three or more variables?\n\n-   Start with your main explanatory variable and main response variable and make a two variable plot\n\n. . .\n\n-   Adding an additional categorical variable\n\n    -   Can you add color (one per category)?\n    -   Can you break a big plot into several small plots (facets)?\n\n. . .\n\n-   Adding an additional numeric variable\n\n    -   Can you add color (along a gradient)?\n    -   Can you add size?\n    \n## Adding variables in ggplot\n\n-   `aes()` (aesthetics) is where we tell R what variables we want represented by what plot elements\n\n-   For example: \n\n    -   `ggplot(acs12, aes(x = income))`\n    -   `ggplot(acs12, aes(x = income, y = married))`\n    -   `ggplot(acs12, aes(x = income, y = married, color = gender))`\n    \n    -   `ggplot(acs12, aes(x = time_to_work, y = lang, size = income))`\n    -   `ggplot(acs12, aes(x = time_to_work, y = lang, color = income))`\n\n    \n## Bar charts for two categorical variables\n\n-   RQ: How do reported rates of texting while driving vary by gender? (in `yrbss`)\n-   We can use color!\n\n    - `color` (for lines and points) and `fill` (for filling in areas like bars) are the arguments we use inside `aes()` to add color.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# if I don't know what variables to look at, I can use glimpse()\nglimpse(yrbss)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 13,583\nColumns: 13\n$ age                      <int> 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 15, 15, 15, 1…\n$ gender                   <chr> \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"fema…\n$ grade                    <chr> \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", \"9\", …\n$ hispanic                 <chr> \"not\", \"not\", \"hispanic\", \"not\", \"not\", \"not\"…\n$ race                     <chr> \"Black or African American\", \"Black or Africa…\n$ height                   <dbl> NA, NA, 1.73, 1.60, 1.50, 1.57, 1.65, 1.88, 1…\n$ weight                   <dbl> NA, NA, 84.37, 55.79, 46.72, 67.13, 131.54, 7…\n$ helmet_12m               <chr> \"never\", \"never\", \"never\", \"never\", \"did not …\n$ text_while_driving_30d   <chr> \"0\", NA, \"30\", \"0\", \"did not drive\", \"did not…\n$ physically_active_7d     <int> 4, 2, 7, 0, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, …\n$ hours_tv_per_school_day  <chr> \"5+\", \"5+\", \"5+\", \"2\", \"3\", \"5+\", \"5+\", \"5+\",…\n$ strength_training_7d     <int> 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, …\n$ school_night_hours_sleep <chr> \"8\", \"6\", \"<5\", \"6\", \"9\", \"8\", \"9\", \"6\", \"<5\"…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this will give me the response options\ntable(yrbss$text_while_driving_30d, \n      yrbss$gender, \n      useNA = \"always\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               \n                female male <NA>\n  0               2254 2534    4\n  1-2              438  487    0\n  10-19            154  219    0\n  20-29            124  174    0\n  3-5              208  282    3\n  30               358  467    2\n  6-9              140  171    0\n  did not drive   2485 2159    2\n  <NA>             460  457    1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Bar charts for two categorical variables\n\n-   `fill = gender` is the argument we want for bar color (an area rather than a point or line)\n-   This is an okay start, but it's not super obvious yet what the story is\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyrbss |> \n  filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(text_while_driving_30d)) |> # remove missing data\n  mutate(text_while_driving_30d = factor(text_while_driving_30d, # change the order of the bars\n                                         levels = c(\"did not drive\", \"0\", \"1-2\", \"3-5\", \n                                                    \"6-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30\"))) |> \n  # we add the fill argument here with the variable we want the fill color to represent.\n  ggplot(aes(x = text_while_driving_30d, fill = gender)) + \n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-plots2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Bar charts for two categorical variables\n\n-   We can set the bars to be next to one another rather than stacked with the `position = \"dodge\"` argument to `geom_bar()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyrbss |> \n  filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(text_while_driving_30d)) |>\n  mutate(text_while_driving_30d = factor(text_while_driving_30d,\n                                         levels = c(\"did not drive\", \"0\", \"1-2\", \"3-5\", \n                                                    \"6-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30\"))) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = text_while_driving_30d, fill = gender)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n  labs(x = \"Number of days last month respondent texted while driving\",\n       y = \"\",\n       # I can change the label on other aes features just like on axes--this goes above the legend\n       fill = \"Sex\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Bar charts for two categorical variables\n\n-   Here the story is clearer!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-plots2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## New plots for two variables: scatter plots and boxplots {.smaller}\n\n-   Scatter plots show the relationship between two numeric variables\n-   Explanatory (independent) variable on the x axis, response (dependent) variable on the y axis\n\n## Scatter plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(acs12, aes(x = time_to_work, y = hrs_work)) + # we specify x and y axis variables here\n  geom_point() + # and this tells R we want a scatter plot\n  labs(x = \"Commute time (minutes)\",\n       y = \"Hours worked per week\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-plots2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scatter plot with color {.smaller}\n\n-   What if we wanted to add a third variable?

It includes lots of example code.\n    -   There are lots of resources here for making plots both more interpretable and more beautiful!\n\n-   If this interests you, I recommend:\n\n    -   [Soc 232: Visualizing Social Data](https://visualizingsociety.com/), taught by Dr. Kieran Healy\n\n        -   or, Dr. Healy's book, [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/)\n    \n    -   [Stat 313: Advanced Data Visualization](https://mine-cr.com/teaching/sta313/), taught by Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\n    \n    -   Soc 223: Data Analytics and Visualization for Business, taught by Dr. Stephen Vaisey\n    \n## Steps to make a plot for your project\n\n-   Step 1: Identify the variables you want to plot and figure out if they're numeric or categorical\n\n    -   Watch out for variables that are *theoretically* numeric but treated in R as categorical (like the texting while driving variable above)\n    \n-   Step 2: Choose a plot type that fits your variables and question\n\n    -   Sketch it out! Figure out what it should look like in your head before you jump into R.\n    -   What should each axis represent? Do you need color or something else in order to include all your variables?\n\n-   Step 3: Look for resources. Find the relevant code in the slides and read the [R Graph Gallery's](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) information about your plot type. \n-   Step 4: Make the super simple version\n-   Step 5: Refine it to make it more interpretable\n    \n    -   My expectation: add labels and drop NA values if necessary\n\n## For tomorrow {.smaller}\n\n-   No exercise on multivariate plots\n-   Try out part 4 of your project instead!
