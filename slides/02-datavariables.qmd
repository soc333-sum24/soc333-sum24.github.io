# Some logistics

## Reminders

-   Drop/add ends tomorrow
-   Class does not meet Fridays--next meeting is Monday
-   The [course syllabus](https://schenewerk.github.io/soc333-sum24/course-syllabus.html) is online. 

## Slides

-   Will be available [on the website](https://schenewerk.github.io/soc333-sum24). Use your arrow keys to navigate.

# Data and Variables

## Sociological data

## Sociological data: Qualitative

::: incremental
-   Interpretations, stories, narratives, observations

-   Uses:

    -   deep understanding of particular cases, theory building, where measurement doesn't work

-   Methods:

    -   interviews, ethnographies, content analysis, image analysis, etc
:::

## Sociological data: Quantitative (this class)

::: incremental
-   Measured quantities. Counts, closed-ended surveys, proportions, outcomes.

-   Uses:

    -   Describing measurable things about the world, theory testing

-   Methods/sources:

    -   Surveys, administrative data, digital trace data, etc
:::

## EADA data (from last time) {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/)
-   Participation, staffing, revenues, and expenditures for men's and women's college sports teams
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Step 1: Data -\> data frame

![](images/02/eada_df.png)

## Observations

-   Each instance that you observe data about (often 1 observation = 1 person, but not always)
-   Rows in your data frame

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variables

-   Aspects that can be different for different cases
-   Columns in your data frame
-   Values the variable can take are called *response options* (especially in the context of surveys)

# Types of variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Categorical

-   Response options have names, not numbers
-   Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, division) do not make sense
-   The book treats these subtypes as the same--we will too for math's sake, but sometimes the difference does play into interpretations

## Categorical: Nominal

-   Simple categories
-   Can't say one category is "bigger" or "smaller" than another
-   Examples: gender identity, race, ethnicity, economic sector

## Categorical: Ordinal

-   You can say that one is "bigger" or "more" than another
-   Examples: education (no hs diploma, hs diploma, some college, 2 year degree, 4 year degree, advanced degree), income (low, middle, high)

## Categorical: Binary

-   Has just two levels: yes/no; present/not present
-   Examples: has college degree/does not have college degree; not ever married/married

## Numeric

-   Response options are numbers where the values are meaningful (ie, not arbitrary)
-   Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc) make sense

## Numeric: Continuous

-   Any value within a range is possible--decimals are fine
-   Examples: Temperature, height, elevation, stock price

## Numeric: Discrete

-   Only certain values (usually round numbers) "make sense" and are used
-   Examples: Age, years of education

## Exercise: EADA data variable types {.smaller}

-   Determine the type of each variable in this data set.
