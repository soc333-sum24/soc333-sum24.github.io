## Logistics {.smaller}

-   Final project proposals due tonight

    -   Update your first draft: incorporate useful peer feedback
    -   Don't forget to add the last paragraph about what question you think you should go with
    -   Any last questions?

. . .

-   Late work policy

    -   You have 3 no-questions-asked late days to use through the semester
    -   Applies to project components and assignments (except final paper and presentation--I can't extend those)

## Today

-   Data analysis process
-   Univariate summaries: what do my variables look like?

## The (approximate) data analysis process {.smaller}

::: columns
::: incremental
-   Determine topic
-   Find data; learn what observations and variables are available
-   Write research question
-   Describe distributions of relevant variables
-   Prepare data frame for analysis
-   Describe relationships between variables
-   Perform statistical tests/write models
-   Communicate results

## Project component 2: Descriptive statistics

Goals:

::: incremental
-   Understand how your variables are distributed in your data

-   Make any necessary modifications to your data frame

    -   Remove irrelevant observations
    -   Modify or create variables as necessary

-   Describe the relationships between your variables
:::

# Understanding how your variables are distributed

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
sports <- readRDS("data/sports_teams.rds")
```

## Today: With numbers (later: with plots)

-   Summary statistics
-   What makes sense depends on variable type

## R syntax for today {.smaller}

-   To access specific variables: `dataframe$variable`
-   Functions do things with variables/other inputs: `do_this(with_this)`
-   We can save results as *objects* to use later with `<-`: `an_object_name <- some_function(some_input)`
    -   eg: `meanvalue <- mean(dataframe$variable)`

## Data set 1 for today: EADA data on sports teams {.smaller}

```{r}
glimpse(sports)
```

## Before we dive in: an intro to missing data

::: incremental
-   Sometimes not everyone answers every question or data is not available for a specific observation
-   Creates `NA` values in your data frame
-   Check for them--they can create unexpected results otherwise
:::

# Categorical variables

## Categorical: What are the options? {.smaller}

-   `unique()`

::: fragment
```{r}
unique(sports$school)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
unique(sports$sport)
```
:::

## Categorical: counts for one variable

-   Counts: `table()`

    -   `useNA = "always"` tells R to let you know if there is any missing data on your variables

```{r}
table(sports$school, useNA = "always")
```

## Categorical: counts for two variables

-   Still `table()`, but use two variables as arguments

```{r}
table(sports$teamgender, sports$school, useNA = "always")
```

## Exercise {.smaller}

-   Today's exercise: in R! Clone and open the project repo now (**ex-5-28-yourusername**)

    -   [Instructions: Computing -\> Cloning and committing](https://soc333-sum24.github.io/computing-clonerepo.html)

-   Data: American Community Survey 2012

```{r}
glimpse(acs12)
```

## Question 1 solutions {.smaller}

Response options for the employment variable

::: fragment
```{r}
unique(acs12$employment)
```
:::

## Question 1 solutions {.smaller}

How many people are in each category? How many missing values are there?

::: fragment
```{r}
table(acs12$employment, useNA = "always")
```
:::

## Question 1 solutions {.smaller}

Create a table that shows the number of people of each gender in each employment category.

::: fragment
```{r}
table(acs12$gender, acs12$employment, useNA = "always")
```
:::

::: fragment
Does it look like gender and employment status are related?
:::

# Numeric variables

## Numeric: All about distributions!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
normdata <- tibble(d = rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 1))
ggplot(normdata, aes(x = d)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
unifdata <- tibble(d = runif(1000, min = 1.5, max = 8.5))
ggplot(unifdata, aes(x = d)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```
:::
:::

## Summarizing a distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   Center
-   Spread
-   Shape
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
normdata <- tibble(d = rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 1))
ggplot(normdata, aes(x = d)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```
:::
:::

## Center: Mean

Say we measure heights of 7 people (in inches):

```{r}
heights <- c(67, 70, 80, 61, 70, 71, 62)
```

::: incremental
-   aka the average
-   Add everything together and divide by the number of values: (66 + 70 + 80 + 62 + 68 + 71 + 62)/7 = 68.7
-   `mean()`
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
mean(heights)
```
:::

## Center: Median

```{r}
heights
```

::: incremental
-   The middle value
-   Order the values least to greatest, select the one in the middle
-   61, 62, 67, **70**, 70, 71, 80
-   `median()`
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
median(heights)
```
:::

## Spread: minimum and maximum

```{r}
min(heights)
```

```{r}
max(heights)
```

## Spread: quartiles {.smaller}

-   **percentiles**
-   lowest 1/4 of your data is below the 25th percentile, lowest 1/2 below 50%, etc
-   Calculated similarly to the median
-   `quantile()`

```{r}
quantile(heights)
```

## Spread: standard deviation {.smaller}

-   Measure of degree of variation in data: bigger standard deviation = more variation
-   Used to establish statistical significance--we'll come back to this later
-   `sd()`

```{r}
heights_moresimilar <- c(60, 63, 62, 60, 61, 61, 64)
```

```{r}
heights
heights_moresimilar
```

```{r}
sd(heights)
```

```{r}
sd(heights_moresimilar)
```

## summary(): (almost) everything all at once

```{r}
summary(sports$nplayers)
```

## Summary statistics functions and missing values {.smaller}

```{r}
mean(acs12$income)
```

-   NA! What!

::: incremental
-   Summary statistics functions will return NA if any of the observations are missing information for the variable
-   Always check for missing data!
-   Use the `na.rm = TRUE` option to tell the function to ignore the NA values.
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
summary(acs12$income)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
mean(acs12$income, na.rm = TRUE)
```
