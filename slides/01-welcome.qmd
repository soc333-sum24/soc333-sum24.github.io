-   What are you looking forward to in Durham this summer (other than this class, of course)?

## Meet this course

-   Quantitative Analysis of Sociological Data

    -   aka, statistics/data science for sociologists

. . .

-   Course learning objectives in a nutshell

    -   To give you a set of tools to use to analyze data and communicate what's happening in the social world

    -   To teach you how to critique data analyses that show up in papers, media, etc

## Your expectations

    -   We will cover everything you need to know

    -   Lots of opportunities to ask questions; lots of in-class practice

## What I need from you

    -   ...but please don't let it distract you (I can tell...)

. . .

-   Be engaged. Participate in class--the work will be easier.

# What we'll do

## Let's meet some data! {.smaller}

# Data Description

## How many coaches were there at Duke in 2021?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dukecoaches2021 <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke", 
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches))

headcoaches2021 <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke",
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender, coachlevel) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches))
  

mensteamcoaches <- dukecoaches2021$totalcoaches[[1]]
womensteamcoaches <- dukecoaches2021$totalcoaches[[2]]

mensheadcoaches <- headcoaches2021$totalcoaches[[2]]
womensheadcoaches <- headcoaches2021$totalcoaches[[4]]
mensasstcoaches <- headcoaches2021$totalcoaches[[1]]
womensasstcoaches <- headcoaches2021$totalcoaches[[3]]
```

. . .

-   `r mensteamcoaches` for men's teams (`r mensheadcoaches` head, `r mensasstcoaches` assistant)
-   `r womensteamcoaches` for women's teams (`r womensheadcoaches` head, `r womensasstcoaches` assistant)

## How has that changed since 2003?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
coachesovertime <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke") |> 
  group_by(year, teamgender, coachlevel) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches)) |> 
  mutate(teamgender = factor(ifelse(teamgender == "men", "men's", "women's"), levels = c("women's", "men's")),
         coachlevel = factor(coachlevel, levels = c("head", "assistant")))

coachtimeplot <- ggplot(coachesovertime, aes(x = year, y = totalcoaches, color = teamgender, linetype = coachlevel)) +

       title = "Change in number of Duke coaches over time",
       color = "Team gender",
       linetype = "Coach level")

How are male and female head coaches distributed between men's and women's teams?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
genderdist <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke",
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender, coachgender, coachlevel) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches)) |> 
  ungroup() 

genderdist_complete <- genderdist |> 
  expand(teamgender, coachgender, coachlevel) |> 
  full_join(genderdist) |> 
  replace_na(list(totalcoaches = 0)) |> 
  mutate(coachgender = factor(coachgender, levels = c("women", "men")),
         coachlevel = factor(ifelse(coachlevel == "head", "Head coaches", "Assistant coaches"),
                             levels = c("Head coaches", "Assistant coaches")),
         teamgender = factor(
           ifelse(teamgender == "men", "Men's teams", "Women's teams"),
           levels = c("Women's teams", "Men's teams")
         )
  )

ggplot(filter(genderdist_complete, coachlevel == "Head coaches"), aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Coach gender",
       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Head coach gender",
       title = "Head coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How are male and female assistant coaches distributed between men's and women's teams?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(genderdist_complete, coachlevel == "Assistant coaches"), aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Assistant coach gender",
       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Assistant coach gender",
       title = "Assistant coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone all together!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(genderdist_complete, aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender),
             rows = vars(coachlevel)) + 
  theme_minimal() +

       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Coach gender",
       title = "All coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Inference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do women and men have the same probability of being hired for coaching jobs?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
genderdist_t <- genderdist_complete |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = coachgender, values_from = totalcoaches)

genderdist_t[1, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[1, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[2, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[2, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[3, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[3, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[4, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[4, 3:4]))$p.value

genderdist_t$sig <- ifelse(genderdist_t$p < .05, "yes", "no")

genderdist_sig <- genderdist_t |> 
  pivot_longer(names_to = 'coachgender', 
               values_to = 'totalcoaches',
               cols = c("men", "women")) |> 
  mutate(coachgender = factor(coachgender, levels = c("women", "men")))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(genderdist_sig, aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender, alpha = sig)) + 
 geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
 facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender),
 rows = vars(coachlevel)) + 
 theme_minimal() + 
 labs(x = "Coach gender",
 y = "Number of coaches",
 fill = "Coach gender",
 title = "All coaches") + 
 theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Results interpretation

## Why might this be?

## What else can we ask with this data set?

# How we'll do it: technology

## Why not these?

|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| ![](images/01/ti84.jpg) | ![](images/01/excel.png) |

## Why not these?

-   Limited functionality

-   Work is not reproducible

-   Expensive!

## Instead! R and RStudio

![](images/01/rstudio.png){fig-alt="An RStudio window" fig-align="center"}

## Instead! R and RStudio

-   Completely reproducible and open-source

-   Lots of flexibility, and capabilities are always expanding

-   A great resume line--it's what the pros use

-   Free!

# Course logistics

## Time check!

keep me on schedule, please--let me know when it's 12:15 :)

## Reminders about summer term

-   Drop/add ends on **Friday** (yes, that is very soon)
-   No class on Memorial Day (May 29) or Juneteenth (June 19)
-   Something up with your enrollment? Talk to me after class.

## Homepage

<https://soc333-sum23.github.io/>

-   All course materials
-   Links to Sakai, GitHub, etc.
-   Let's take a tour!

## Activities {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Readings:** All available free online. Best if completed before class.
-   **Class:** You are expected to attend every day. Your assignments will be much easier if you take advantage of in-class opportunities to complete them.
-   **In-class exercises:** Complete (at least mostly) during class each day. Turn them in before the next class period. Graded for completion. You'll have to do these on your own if you miss class.
-   **Homework:** Two additional out-of-class assignments.
-   **Project:** Final project, developed in pieces through the course of the semester. Paper and presentation due at the end.
