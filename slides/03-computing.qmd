# Toolkit: Computing

## Learning goals {.smaller}

By the end of the course, you will be able to...

::: incremental
-   gain insight from data
-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}

::: question
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
:::

. . .

**Near-term goals:**

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long-term goals:**

-   Can other people check your work?
-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Toolkit for reproducibility

-   Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R / RStudio
-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto
-   Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

## R and RStudio {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/r-logo.png){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center"}

-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
-   It's easily extensible with *packages*
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
![](images/02/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt="RStudio logo"}

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## Tour: R and RStudio

# Quarto

## Quarto

::: incremental
-   A text editor, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs--but it does code too!
-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is run from the beginning
:::

## Tour: Quarto

![](images/02/tour-quarto.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE with a Quarto document, source code on the left and output on the right. Annotated to show the YAML, a link, a header, and a code chunk." fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every assignment / report / project / etc. is a Quarto document
-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

# Toolkit: Version control and collaboration

## Git and GitHub {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/git-logo.png){fig-alt="Git logo" fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/github-logo.png){fig-alt="GitHub logo" fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

## Install time!

-   Setting up is the hardest part...
-   Go to our course webpage (soc333-sum23.github.io), click on "Computing" in the side bar, and then click on "Setup".
-   Today's exercise: Work through these installation steps with a partner on the same operating system

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_these)
```

. . .

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## R essentials (continued)

-   Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#| eval: false
dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

-   Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mean
```
