## Bar charts for two categorical variables

-   Example: How is the probability of obtaining a college degree related to self-identified income category?

```{r}
table(gss$college, gss$finrela)
```

## Bar charts for two categorical vars

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   Example: How is the probability of obtaining a college degree related to self-identified income category?
-   Stacked bar chart: Good at showing the overall distribution. We can see that most people think their income is average.

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(gss, 
       aes(x = finrela, fill = college)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Relative family income",
       y = "")

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(gss, 
       aes(x = finrela, fill = college)) + 
  # the "position" argument here

  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Relative family income",
       y = "")

::: incremental
-   Proportion bar chart: Good at comparing the compositions of the bars. We lose information on the distribution as a whole, but we gain information on whether people from both groups are evenly distributed between income classes.

# Where we're at with hypothesis testing

## There are many types of tests

![](images/16/test_table_nologit.png)

## But the steps to run them are the same

1.  Calculate the test statistic of your sample

    -   with `specify()` (telling R what your variables are),
    -   then `hypothesize()` (telling R what kind of null hypothesis you have),
    -   then `calculate()` (calculating your test statistic)

2.  Simulate the null distribution

    -   exactly the same code as step 1, but with an added `generate()` step
    -   here you are simulating pulling a bunch of samples from your null population in order to figure out what the null distribution of sample statistics would look like

3.  Calculate the p value of your sample

    -   with your null distribution, your test statistic, and `get_p_value()`

4.  Visualize the test statistic of your sample alongside the null distribution

    -   with `visualize()` and `shade_p_value()`

## In code form:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# 1. Calculate test statistic
test_stat <- XXXX |> 
  specify(explanatory = XXXX,
          response = XXXX) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |> 
  calculate(stat = XXXX)

# 2. Simulate null distribution
null_dist <- XXXX |> 
  specify(explanatory = XXXX,
          response = XXXX) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000) |>
  calculate(stat = XXXX)

# 3. Use both to get the p value
get_p_value(null_dist,
            obs_stat = test_stat,
            direction = XXXX)

# 4. Visualize it!
visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat,
                direction = XXXX)
```

# What are the different tests testing?

## Different tests: an overview

-   We'll be covering 5 specific hypothesis tests (all except logistic regression)

    -   Two sample Z test
    -   Two sample T test
    -   Chi square test of independence
    -   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
    -   Linear regression

. . .

-   There is a relationship between the descriptive plots you've been working with and the different test types!

## Two sample Z test

-   Explanatory: categorical with two categories
-   Response: categorical with two categories
-   Testing for: Difference in group proportions!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = college, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Two sample T test

-   Explanatory: categorical with two categories
-   Response: numeric
-   Testing for: Difference in group means!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = college, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Chi square test of independence

-   Explanatory: categorical with any number of categories
-   Response: categorical with any number of categories
-   Testing for: Patterns in how observations are distributed between groups!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = finrela, fill = college)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Chi square test of independence

-   Explanatory: categorical with any number of categories
-   Response: categorical with any number of categories
-   Testing for: Patterns in how observations are distributed between groups!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = finrela, fill = partyid)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

-   Explanatory: categorical with three or more categories
-   Response: numeric
-   Testing for: Differences in means between more groups!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = partyid, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Linear regression

-   Explanatory: numeric or multiple variables
-   Response: numeric
-   Testing for: Non-zero slopes!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = age, y = hours)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# What's the math difference?

## What's the math difference?

-   Mainly, the shape of the test statistic distribution.
-   We account for this in two places:
    -   the `stat` argument in `calculate()`
    -   the `direction` argument in `get_p_value()` and `visualize()`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
z <- gss |> 
  specify(college ~ sex, success = "no degree") |> 
  assume ("z")

t <- gss |> 
  specify(age ~ college) |> 
  assume ("t")

chisq <- gss |> 
  specify(finrela ~ sex) |> 
  assume("Chisq")

f <- gss |> 
  specify(age ~ partyid) |> 
  assume("F")

zplot <- visualize(z)
tplot <- visualize(t)
chisqplot <- visualize(chisq)
fplot <- visualize(f)
```

## Normal and nearly normal distributions

-   Normal: Two sample Z test, linear regression slope test
-   Nearly normal (t distribution): Two sample T test
-   Symmetrical; centered at 0; bell-shaped
-   Either one-tailed or two-tailed tests make sense

```{r, echo = FALSE}
zplot + tplot &
  theme_classic()
```

## Asymmetrical distributions

-   Chi-square test: chi square distribution
-   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): F distribution
-   These values can be thought of as *distances*
-   Strictly positive; asymmetrical and long-tailed
-   "More extreme" means further away---ie, more positive. So all tests are one-tailed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
chisqplot + fplot &
  theme_classic()
```

## Different tests: summary

| **Test**          | **stat = XXXX** | **direction = XXXX**  | **Notes**                                                                                        |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Two sample Z test | `"z"`           | usually `"two-sided"` | Needs `success = XXXX` in `specify()`, where XXXX is one of the options of the response variable |
| Two sample T test | `"t"`           | usually `"two-sided"` |                                                                                                  |
| Chi square test   | `"Chisq"`       | `"greater"`           |                                                                                                  |
| ANOVA             | `"F"`           | `"greater"`           | `hypothesize()` optional for test statistic                                                      |
| Linear regression | `"slope"`       | usually `"two-sided"` | `hypothesize()` optional for test statistic                                                      |

## Example

-   How is self-perceived relative family income associated with probability of receiving a college degree?

. . .

-   **Explanatory**: Self-perceived relative family income. Three or more category categorical.
-   **Response**: Whether or not someone received a college degree. Two-category categorical.

. . .

-   **Null hypothesis**: There is no relationship between self-perceived relative family income and probability of receiving a college degree.
-   **Alternative hypothesis**: There is a relationship between self-perceived relative family income and probability of receiving a college degree.

## Example

```{r}
ggplot(gss, aes(x = finrela, fill = college)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Chi square example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# 1. Calculate test statistic
test_stat <- gss |> 
  specify(explanatory = finrela,
          response = college) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |> 
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")       # calculate the Chi square statistic
```

## Chi square example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# 1. Calculate test statistic
test_stat <- gss |> 
  specify(explanatory = finrela,
          response = college) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |> 
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")       # calculate the Chi square statistic

# 2. Simulate null distribution
null_dist <- gss |> 
  specify(explanatory = finrela,
          response = college) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000) |>
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")
```

## Chi square example

```{r}
# 1. Calculate test statistic
test_stat <- gss |> 
  specify(explanatory = finrela,
          response = college) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |> 
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")       # calculate the Chi square statistic

# 2. Simulate null distribution
null_dist <- gss |> 
  specify(explanatory = finrela,
          response = college) |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000) |>
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")

# 3. Use both to get the p value
get_p_value(null_dist,
            obs_stat = test_stat,
            direction = "greater") # we want the probability of a statistic larger than what we calculated
```

## Chi square example

-   Do we reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis?
-   What can we conclude about our research question?

```{r}
# 4. Visualize it!
visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat,
                direction = "greater")
```
