    "text": "This page will introduce you to the course computing workflow. We will set up everything you need in order to start using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub‚Äìfour powerful programs that you will be learning to use to analyze data in this class.\nR is a programming language, like Python, C++, Java, and many others. That means it can be used to do all kinds of things. Its primary strength, however, is data analysis, and it is used by many social scientists, statisticians, data scientists, and others to clean, model, transform, and visualize all kinds of data.\nRStudio is an interface for using R‚Äìbasically, a nice text editor with bells and whistles that are specific to writing code. There are other ways to write programs in R, but most people use RStudio because it is both powerful and free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nGit and GitHub are the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course. They can be used for any kind of file‚Äìnot just R. It is likely you‚Äôll run into them if you ever do any work involving writing code that needs to be made available to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like Box but much better).\n\n\nToday, we simply aim to get these four tools set up and talking to one another.\nThe good news: All of this only needs to be done one time‚Äìafter this, you‚Äôre set not just for the rest of this class, but for whenever you use these tools again in future!\nThe bad news: It‚Äôs a tedious and nonintuitive process. If you find it frustrating and/or confusing, it‚Äôs not just you. Stick with it, and ask when you get stuck‚Äìwe will take as much time as necessary to make sure it works for everyone.\n\n\nBy time you go through the steps on this page and in the repo cloning page that it pairs with, you will‚Ä¶\n\nHave a functioning R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub setup\nHave an introduction to our course workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto\nPractice version control using GitHub",

Packages are basically bundles of code that people write and release that make it easier to do specific tasks in R.\nCopy and paste the following code into the RStudio console. Then hit enter.\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\n\nYour computer might take a few moments to download and install the required code.

Look at the console (left hand window). You should see another tab right next to the word ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù that says ‚ÄúTerminal.‚Äù Click on this. In the terminal window, paste the following code, then hit enter:\n\nwhich git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe console sends instructions to R. The terminal, on the other hand, sends instructions to the operating system of your computer. The terminal is often used to install and update things and create/delete/move files on your computer.\n\n\nThis checks if you have git installed. If so, it will show a file path‚Äìon a mac, something like /usr/local/bin/git. Congrats, you‚Äôre good to go! Move to Step 5.\nIf instead you see something like git: command not found , you need to install git. Proceed to Step 4.\n\n\nStep 4: Install Git\nThe process varies somewhat by operating system (mac vs windows vs linux). I recommend following the appropriate instructions here.\n\n\nStep 5: Configure Git\nPaste the following code into the RStudio console (you may have to click back into the console if you are still in the terminal from Step 3), edit it to contain your GitHub username and email address, then hit enter.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your_GitHub_username\",\n  user.email = \"your_github_email@example.com\"\n)",

Using the feedback provided by your classmates, you will choose one to pursue further.\n\n\nYou will need to find two data sets: one for each of your research questions. You may write additional research questions on a single data set if you would like additional feedback, but in all cases, you must consider and present at least two data sets in total.\nI highly recommend selecting data sets included with the openintro package. There is all kinds of interesting data freely available on the internet, but it is a good idea to stick with openintro because their data sets are clean and easy to work with. We already have a lot to do in just 6 weeks, and so will not be covering how to prepare ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data for analysis (I recommend a data science course like STA 199 for this!). If you really want to use a data set from elsewhere instead, talk to me.\nNot all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements). Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 observations and two interesting variables. Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook. You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.\nI recommend the below data sets, all of which are included in openintro. Click on the links to see some basic information about them. To access any of them in R, just load the openintro package, then use their names.\n\nacs12\ncia_factbook\ncounty_2019\ncounty_complete\nevals\ngpa\ngss2010\nhfi\nhsb2\nlabor_market_discrimination\nmilitary\nmn_police_use_of_force\nncbirths\npiracy\nresume\nsatgpa\nsowc_demographics\nvoter_count\nyrbss\n\n\n\n\nYou are required to propose a minimum of 2 research questions, to be answered with 2 separate data sets, that you‚Äôre interested in potentially using for the final project. If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions. You will review each others‚Äô proposals in groups of 2-3. After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.\nFor each research question, you should:\n\nClearly state the specific research question. Make sure it fulfills the following requirements:\n\nMust fulfill the requirements of a good research question: specific, feasible, sociological\nMust involve a relationship between at least two variables\nMust be answerable with quantitative data and simple statistics\n\nAdditionally, provide some supporting information:\n\nWhat is your target population?\nWrite down a hypothesis stating what you expect to find. Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many observations are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nDiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of this data set with respect to your research question and target population. Does the sampling strategy make it a good fit? What are its limitations?\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a first look at the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. You should revise your questions if they need it. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice? Discuss quality of the research question (in terms of being specific, feasible, and sociological) and the ability of the data set to answer the question well.\n\nSubmit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph.",

    "text": "In this component, you will think through two possible research questions and data sets. Using the feedback provided by your classmates, you will choose one to pursue further.\n\n\nYou will need to find two data sets: one for each of your research questions. You may write additional research questions on a single data set if you would like additional feedback, but in all cases, you must consider and present at least two data sets in total.\nI highly recommend selecting data sets included with the openintro package. There is all kinds of interesting data freely available on the internet, but it is a good idea to stick with openintro because their data sets are clean and easy to work with. We already have a lot to do in just 6 weeks, and so will not be covering how to prepare ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data for analysis (I recommend a data science course like STA 199 for this!). If you really want to use a data set from elsewhere instead, talk to me.\nNot all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements). Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 observations and two interesting variables. Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook. You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.\nI recommend the below data sets, all of which are included in openintro. Click on the links to see some basic information about them. To access any of them in R, just load the openintro package, then use their names.\n\nacs12\ncia_factbook\ncounty_2019\ncounty_complete\nevals\ngpa\ngss2010\nhfi\nhsb2\nlabor_market_discrimination\nmilitary\nmn_police_use_of_force\nncbirths\npiracy\nresume\nsatgpa\nsowc_demographics\nvoter_count\nyrbss\n\n\n\n\nYou are required to propose a minimum of 2 research questions, to be answered with 2 separate data sets, that you‚Äôre interested in potentially using for the final project. If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions. You will review each others‚Äô proposals in groups of 2-3. After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.\nFor each research question, you should:\n\nClearly state the specific research question. Make sure it fulfills the following requirements:\n\nMust fulfill the requirements of a good research question: specific, feasible, sociological\nMust involve a relationship between at least two variables\nMust be answerable with quantitative data and simple statistics\n\nAdditionally, provide some supporting information:\n\nWhat is your target population?\nWrite down a hypothesis stating what you expect to find. Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many observations are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nDiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of this data set with respect to your research question and target population. Does the sampling strategy make it a good fit? What are its limitations?\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a first look at the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. You should revise your questions if they need it. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice? Discuss quality of the research question (in terms of being specific, feasible, and sociological) and the ability of the data set to answer the question well.\n\nSubmit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph.",

However, you must edit to ensure that your report meets all requirements listed here, all your code runs, and everything reads well as a cohesive whole. You must also address any relevant feedback you received on previous components. Do not just paste your three previous assignments together in one document; this will not meet requirements and will score poorly.\n\n\nRead your group member‚Äôs paper.

We can add a third numeric variable using size or color.\nHere, I am putting hours worked on the x axis (as an explanatory variable), income on the y axis (as a dependent variable), and using color to plot respondent age (also an explanatory variable).\nThis is the super simple version of this plot. It could be improved by dropping NA values and adding labels.\n\nggplot(acs12, aes(x = hrs_work, y = income, color = age)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 1041 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the same plot, but here I‚Äôm mapping the age variable using size (and I‚Äôm dropping NA values‚Äìnotice how this changes the age scale to start around 20, rather than 0). This varies the size of the points based on the value of age.\n\nacs12 |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(hrs_work)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = hrs_work, y = income, size = age)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, income seems to rise with hours worked, at least up to a point.

All data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations should be done in that single file, so that your entire document is 100% reproducible (i.e., someone else should be able to take your file, click ‚Äúrender‚Äù or ‚Äúrun‚Äù, and recreate your results and visualizations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nWhy peer feedback? Very few people work in isolation. We constantly get feedback from colleagues, and learning how to give and receive such feedback in a way that makes projects better is essential for coursework as well as for most jobs.\nWhy Quarto? While there is, of course, a learning curve associated with writing analyses in a new way (ie, in Quarto instead of text editors you are more used to, like Word and Google Docs), it is a skill worth learning for statistical analysis in particular. Why? Quarto allows you to easily make your work entirely reproducible. You will be able to give a collaborator one single document that shows all steps in the analysis process as well as all necessary background information and explanation. This makes your work easy for others to understand, check, and modify. Using Quarto also encourages you to learn good coding practices, right from the beginning. You will be explaining what you do as you go along, and the way files are compiled will encourage you to write code that runs correctly in order‚Äìwhich may not sound like much, but it‚Äôs actually quite easy to get disorganized when coding in other ways. We will go over Quarto in class so that you have all the information and support you need to learn it.",

I expect this because universities are required to adhere to Title IX, which would prohibit different levels of resources for equivalent sports.\nWrite down the name of your data set (from component 1)\nI will be using the EADA data set on equity in college athletics.\nWrite down the names of the variables you will use in your analysis (i.e., what you need to type to access them in R)\nncoaches, teamgender, sport\nFor each variable, write:\n\nA brief description of what it measures\nWhether it is an explanatory (independent) variable, a response (dependent) variable, or something else (explain what)\nWhat kind of variable it is (categorical or numeric and which subtype within these)\n\n\nncoaches: This measures the number of coaches on each team. It is my response variable. It is a discrete numeric variable.\nteamgender: This records the gender of the players on the team. It is an explanatory variable and it is nominal categorical.\nsport: I will use this variable to limit my data frame to the sports that have both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams. It is a nominal categorical variable.\n\n\nPart 2: Univariate distributions\n\nFor each of your variables:\n\nLook at its distribution using the summary() or table() function (as appropriate to its type).\nIndicate how many missing values (NAs) there are.\nIn ~2-3 sentences, describe what you see in the results. Note anything that surprises you.\n\n\nncoaches:\nThe minimum number of coaches per team is one, the median is four, and the maximum is 14. There are no missing values. The fourth quartile is much wider than the other three (spanning from 4-14), and the mean (3.9) is larger than the median, suggesting that the data may be skewed to the right. In other words, there may be a small number of teams with a large number of coaches relative to the rest.\nThe median and the cutoff point for the third quartile are the same (both equal 4), indicating that four is a really common number of coaches for teams to have.\n\nsummary(sports$ncoaches)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Explain why or why not. If not, which will you include and which will you exclude?\nI will not analyze all of the observations in my data set because analyzing all of them would make for an unfair comparison. There is a different set of sports available for men than for women. I am interested in comparing the number of coaches for comparable men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, so I will exclude sports for which there are only men‚Äôs teams or only women‚Äôs teams (e.g., football, softball).\nDo you need to create any new variables?

Depending on your variable types, this might be a scatter plot, box plot, bar chart, etc. Include meaningful axis labels.\nInterpret your plot in a few sentences. Does it appear these variables are associated with one another? Does anything about the relationship surprise you? Is it consistent or inconsistent with your hypothesis?\nAs suggested by the univariate summary statistics, the distribution of the number of coaches is skewed to the right. The distributions look nearly identical for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, so it appears that team gender and staffing levels are probably not associated with one another. This is consistent with my hypothesis and is not very surprising, though I was not expecting the distributions to be as extraordinarily similar as they appear here.\n\n\n# I have one numeric and one categorical variable, so a boxplot (as in example code in the assignment template) would also be a good choice here--but for variety I will show the same information in histogram form\nggplot(data = sports_filtered, aes(x = ncoaches, fill = teamgender)) + \n  geom_histogram(\n    position = position_dodge(), # this puts the bars next to each other\n    binwidth = 1\n    ) + \n  labs(x = \"Number of coaches\",\n       y = \"Number of teams\",\n       title = \"Distribution of staffing levels by team gender for Duke and UNC sports\",\n       fill = \"Team gender\")"

    "text": "library(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(infer)\nset.seed(1)\n\n\nIntroduction\nSports, particularly at high levels of competition, are often strictly gender-segregated. At the college and professional levels in the United States, men and women (people of other genders must generally abide by one of those categories to participate) generally play on different teams and in different leagues. Rules are often slightly different between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs versions of a sport, and the set of sports available to women is slightly different than that available to men. This separation makes it possible for levels of resources to vary greatly between men and women. At the professional level, women‚Äôs leagues generally have lower viewership and attendance, less infrastructure, and lower athlete salaries than men‚Äôs leagues (Cooky, Council, Mears, and Messner 2021).\nWe would expect things to look different on the college level. Title IX, passed in 1972, was intended to prohibit such gender inequities in sports affiliated with most educational institutions. Was it effective? In this work, I address this by investigating the research question: How does the number of coaches assigned to US college sports teams vary by the gender of the team?\n\n\nData and methodology\nTo answer this research question, I use publicly available data on college athletics programs from the Office of Postsecondary Education in the U.S. Department of Education. This observational data is provided to the Department of Education by university athletic programs in order to comply with the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA). It contains information on available sports, staffing levels, number of athletes, revenue, and spending, all broken down by team gender. This makes it an ideal data set for studying gender-based inequities in American university athletics programs.\nThe subset of this data that I will use contains information on the athletics programs at Duke University and the University of North Carolina‚ÄìChapel Hill between 2003 and 2021. 879 unique teams are represented in this subset. In order to draw conclusions about differences in staffing between comparable men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, I exclude all teams in sports that are only available for one gender, such as football and softball.\n\nsports &lt;- readRDS(\"sports_teams.rds\")\n\nsports_filtered &lt;- sports |&gt; \n  filter(\n    sport != \"Baseball\",\n    sport != \"Field Hockey\",\n    sport != \"Football\",\n    sport != \"Gymnastics\",\n    sport != \"Rowing\",\n    sport != \"Softball\",\n    sport != \"Volleyball\",\n    sport != \"Wrestling\"\n  )\n\nMy response variable is the number of coaches assigned to a team. This includes coaches at all levels (assistant and head) and employee statuses (part time and full time). It is a discrete numeric variable ranging from 1 to 14 coaches, with a mean of 3.9 and a median of 3. It is right skewed: most teams have a small number of coaches and only a few have many coaches.\n\nsummary(sports_filtered$ncoaches)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   1.00    3.00    3.00    3.88    4.00   14.00 \n\n\nMy explanatory variable is the gender of the team. This is a nominal categorical variable with two levels: ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale.‚Äù There are 304 teams of each gender in this data set.\n\ntable(sports_filtered$teamgender)\n\n\n  men women \n  304   304 \n\n\nIn order to examine the relationship between these two variables, I will use a one-tailed T test. A T test is the correct choice of hypothesis test for a question that employs a categorical variable with two levels as the explanatory variable and a numeric variable as the response variable. It will allow me to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between these two variables. I use a one-tailed test because my alternative hypothesis is directional‚Äîmy alternative hypothesis is that women‚Äôs teams are less well-staffed than comparable men‚Äôs teams, while my null hypothesis is that staffing levels are the same regardless of team gender.\n\n\nResults\nFigure 1 compares the distribution of number of coaches for men‚Äôs teams with that of women‚Äôs teams. If women‚Äôs teams are less well-staffed than men‚Äôs teams, we would see that the distribution for women‚Äôs teams would be positioned lower than that for men‚Äôs teams. However, there are no notable differences between genders detectable in this figure. The distributions for men and for women are both centered in the same place and have the same range and quartile divisions. If differences exist, they are very small and perhaps not very meaningful.\n\nggplot(data = sports_filtered, aes(x = ncoaches, y = teamgender)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Number of coaches\",\n       y = \"Team gender\",\n       title = \"Figure 1: Distribution of number of coaches by team gender\",\n       subtitle = \"Duke and UNC teams between 2003 and 2021\",\n       fill = \"Team gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of a one-tailed T test show that the relationship between team gender and number of coaches is statistically insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). I fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between these two variables. In other words, these data do not provide evidence that there is any detectable difference between the number of coaches assigned to men‚Äôs teams and the number of coaches assigned to women‚Äôs teams.\n\nsports_teststat &lt;- sports_filtered |&gt; \n  specify(formula = ncoaches ~ teamgender) |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"t\",\n            order = c(\"men\", \"women\"))\n\nsports_nulldist &lt;- sports_filtered |&gt; \n  specify(formula = ncoaches ~ teamgender) |&gt; \n  generate(reps = 1000) |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"t\",\n            order = c(\"men\", \"women\"))\n\nget_p_value(sports_nulldist, obs_stat = sports_teststat, direction = \"greater\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  p_value\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   0.505\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\nIn sum, using data on staffing levels in the Duke and UNC athletics programs between 2003 and 2021, I found that the number of coaches assigned to comparable men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams is very similar. This supports the theory that Title IX has been effective at negating gender inequities in resources in college-level sports. This work has several limitations that affect the scope of its conclusions, however.\nFirst, only two schools are represented in this data set. Both are selective institutions with Division 1 athletics programs, and both are located in the same state. These results may not hold among Division 2 and 3 schools, which have smaller budgets and so may have different factors at play when choosing how to allocate funds. They may also not hold among schools in other parts of the country and other athletic conferences. Adding more schools, and a larger variety of schools, would strengthen the generalizability of these results.\nSecond, I did not differentiate between coaches at different levels, of different employee statuses, or with different levels of experience and skill. It is possible that the number of coaches assigned to comparable men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams is similar, but coaches for women‚Äôs teams are more likely to be part-time employees and so spend less time with athletes. It is also possible that there are differences in the salaries or benefits offered to coaches on men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, which could result in coaches for women‚Äôs teams being less experienced or less skilled than coaches for men‚Äôs teams. Using different response variables that more thoroughly capture the characteristics of coaches would strengthen these conclusions by exploring some of these possibilities.\nThese results suggest several other fruitful directions for future work. First, coaching is only one of a host of resources provided to college athletics teams. Future work could investigate gender equity on other measures, like infrastructure and aid offered to athletes. Additionally, future work could more conclusively determine whether Title IX is what prevents gender inequity in sports, which this work cannot definitively speak to. Researchers could do this by comparing data from before and after the implementation of the law, and perhaps by using qualitative methods like interviews to explore the memories and motivations of administrators involved in decisions about resource allocation. Finally, future work could examine resource differences between the full set of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sports, rather than just those available to both genders. It could be that there are overall differences in coaching levels that are driven not by differential assignment of coaches to similar teams, but rather by the fact that different sports with different coaching requirements are made available to men and women. Now that we know that there are no detectable differences in comparable sports, investigating this alternate possibility is a logical next step.\n\n\nReferences\nCooky, C., Council, L. D., Mears, M.

It has two main weaknesses. First, it uses a convenience sample of Reddit users active in the r/financialindependence subreddit. This group is likely much more interested in and perhaps more knowledgeable about finances than people who do not choose to spend time in this subreddit, and so their financial trajectories post-pandemic were likely different than for others. This impairs the generalizability of results. Second, the ‚Äúpan_inc_chg‚Äù variable is a self-reported estimate, not an exact value. People may have misremembered or misjudged their income change.

I expect this because universities are required to adhere to Title IX, which would prohibit differential levels of resources for equivalent sports.\nData: These data were reported by Duke and UNC annually from 2003-2021. It is an observational study. All coaches from both institutions are represented in the data set. It contains 2311 observations (team-years).\nVariables: I will use the teamgender, sport, and ncoaches variables to answer this question.\nStrengths and weaknesses: A strength of this data set is that it is administrative data, and so represents all coaches that were employed by these institutions. A weakness is that only two institutions are represented, and both are highly selective institutions with strong athletics programs. This limits the generalizability of the results to institutions that are less selective and that have less resourced athletics programs.\n\nsports &lt;- readRDS(\"sports_teams.rds\") # This data set is not part of openintro, so this line is needed to load it from a file instead.\n\nglimpse(sports)\n\nRows: 879\nColumns: 8\n$ school             &lt;chr&gt; \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Du‚Ä¶\n$ year               &lt;dbl&gt; 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 200‚Ä¶\n$ division           &lt;chr&gt; \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Div‚Ä¶\n$ teamgender         &lt;chr&gt; \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"m‚Ä¶\n$ sport              &lt;chr&gt; \"Baseball\", \"Basketball\", \"Fencing\", \"Football\", \"G‚Ä¶\n$ ncoaches           &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 6, 13, 2‚Ä¶\n$ nplayers           &lt;dbl&gt; 33, 15, 19, 81, 12, 45, 23, 32, 11, 50, 35, 35, 30,‚Ä¶\n$ player_coach_ratio &lt;dbl&gt; 11.000000, 3.750000, 19.000000, 8.100000, 6.000000,‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I should pursue research question 2, on the level of staffing of college sports teams by team gender. Although I believe both research questions are sufficiently specific, feasible, and sociological, I think the data set I would use to answer question 2 is a better fit for the question than the data set I would use to answer question 1. The fact that my data set for question 1 is a convenience sample of users of one particular subreddit dramatically reduces the ability of any analysis to generalize to a broad population. The data set that I would use for question 2 is also limited by its sample‚Äîit contains coaches at just two universities. However, it contains every coach that worked at each of those institutions, and those institutions are representative of a broader group of universities that would be interesting to generalize to (selective universities with strong athletics programs)."

I expect this because universities are required to adhere to Title IX, which would prohibit differential levels of resources for equivalent sports.\nData: These data were reported by Duke and UNC annually from 2003-2021. It is an observational study. All coaches from both institutions are represented in the data set. It contains 2311 observations (team-years).\nVariables: I will use the teamgender, sport, and ncoaches variables to answer this question.\nStrengths and weaknesses: A strength of this data set is that it is administrative data, and so represents all coaches that were employed by these institutions. A weakness is that only two institutions are represented, and both are highly selective institutions with strong athletics programs. This limits the generalizability of the results to institutions that are less selective and that have less resourced athletics programs.\n\nsports &lt;- readRDS(\"sports_teams.rds\") # This data set is not part of openintro, so this line is needed to load it from a file instead.\n\nglimpse(sports)\n\nRows: 879\nColumns: 8\n$ school             &lt;chr&gt; \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Du‚Ä¶\n$ year               &lt;dbl&gt; 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 200‚Ä¶\n$ division           &lt;chr&gt; \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Div‚Ä¶\n$ teamgender         &lt;chr&gt; \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"m‚Ä¶\n$ sport              &lt;chr&gt; \"Baseball\", \"Basketball\", \"Fencing\", \"Football\", \"G‚Ä¶\n$ ncoaches           &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 6, 13, 2‚Ä¶\n$ nplayers           &lt;dbl&gt; 33, 15, 19, 81, 12, 45, 23, 32, 11, 50, 35, 35, 30,‚Ä¶\n$ player_coach_ratio &lt;dbl&gt; 11.000000, 3.750000, 19.000000, 8.100000, 6.000000,‚Ä¶"

Although I believe both research questions are sufficiently specific, feasible, and sociological, I think the data set I would use to answer question 2 is a better fit for the question than the data set I would use to answer question 1. The fact that my data set for question 1 is a convenience sample of users of one particular subreddit dramatically reduces the ability of any analysis to generalize to a broad population. The data set that I would use for question 2 is also limited by its sample‚Äîit contains coaches at just two universities. However, it contains every coach that worked at each of those institutions, and those institutions are representative of a broader group of universities that would be interesting to generalize to (selective universities with strong athletics programs)."

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to quantitative research methods. On a basic level, this means teaching you how to perform statistical analysis of data, which we will do using the programming language R. But ‚Äòresearch‚Äô is more than plugging numbers into formulae: it involves developing research questions, finding (or collecting) and evaluating datasets, and using well-informed statistical methods to analyze that data. In this course, we will discuss and practice each step of that process, in order to develop your skills as social scientists.\nAdditionally, good scientific research is well-documented and reproducible‚Äìthat is, another researcher who comes after you would be able to both understand your methods and to replicate your results. As you develop your analytical computing skills over the summer, you will also be introduced to methods and best practices for ensuring this is the case‚Äìboth so that you can understand what you‚Äôve done, after the fact, and so that other social scientists can build on your work in the future.",

I expect this because students that sleep their recommended hours will study more effectively and energy levels will be higher\nD.

I plan to use the gpa data set from the openintro package to answer this question. It is an observational study surveying 55 Duke University students on GPA, studying, and more\nF. The strengths of this data set is that it includes relevant variables such as GPA, hours slept per night, and gender, which are directly pertinent to your research question. The research question is also specific and clearly defined, focusing on a particular demographic, female Duke students and a specific variable, hours of sleep per night, in relation to GPA. This specificity can lead to more precise and actionable insights. This data set has a main weakness dealing with the sample size. The data set consists of only 55 students which is a small sample size that may not provide a view of the entire female student population at Duke University. This could potentially limit the generalization of the findings\nglimpse(gpa)\n\n\nResearch question 2:\nA. How does the type of police force used by Minneapolis police vary by the race of male subjects?\nB. All individuals involved in police use-of-force incidents in Minneapolis is the target population\nC. I believe that the type of police force used by Minneapolis police officers is more likely to be severe against African Americans males compared to those who are White. I expect this because ongoing reports of racial profiling and discrimination within law enforcement practices, highlighted by media coverage and community reports, frequently indicate that police use disproportionate force against minority individuals.\nD. I plan to use the mn_police_use_of_force data set from the openintro package to answer this question. It is an observational using Minneapolis police use of force data from 2016 through August 2021.\nE. To answer this question, I would use the variables ‚Äúforce_type‚Äùand ‚Äúrace‚Äù\nF. The strength of this data set is in the coverage of multiple years and its specificity to Minneapolis, allowing for a detailed examination of local police practices. Additionally, the observational nature of the data captures real-world scenarios, providing a broad view of police interactions. On the other hand, the sampling strategy, being observational and encompassing a significant time frame, is a good fit for understanding trends and disparities, but it may not account for all contextual factors influencing police behavior\nglimpse(mn_police_use_of_force)"
