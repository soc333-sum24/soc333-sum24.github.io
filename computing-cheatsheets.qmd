title: "R resources and cheatsheets"
---

There are many freely available online resources for learning R that you may find helpful, either for this course or in the future.

I highly recommend the online textbook [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, which does an excellent job introducing the skills you need in order to explore data in R.

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be a great resource when you are asking "how do I do X specific thing?" or "why am I getting this error message?". Just remember to cite any code that you copy from here.

The following cheatsheets come from <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets>. We haven't covered every function and functionality listed on them, but you might still find them useful as references.
